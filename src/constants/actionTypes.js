/* 
  Why use action types at all??
  - in a small project it might not be necessary! but the overhead is small enough to almost always warrant using them
  - consistent naming across project
  - helpful to reference existing actions when working on features to prevent duplicate code
  - when trying to dispatch an imported action, if you spell it incorrectly it will throw a reference error immediately, instead of sending an incorrect dispatch which will do nothing. Much easier for debugging!
