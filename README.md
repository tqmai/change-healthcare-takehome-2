This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Design considerations:

I stored the game data in an object whose keys are the "Order" of the games and values are all the other related game data. This helped with determining the correct order of games to display in the app because I could more easily access the "Order" property of each game (as compared to parsing through every entry to find the Order property). This also allows for O(1) lookup time (as compared to iterating through an array).

I used local state in the GameListing component because the rest of the application does not care about this data. I personally feel like it is unnecessary extra work to store the "detailsShown" value in a Redux store and have to use actions/reducers to modify that value.

I separated the reducers into two files grouped by function. This was to make it clearer which actions were related.

When importing the data, I chose to parse through it instead of saving it all directly in the store. This way, I can reduce data usage while also allowing for progress status of the importing of data.

I chose not to order the games by their "Order" property because many games share the same Order value. I opted instead to order by ID because the games all have unique IDs.
